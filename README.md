# Day-Calendar

## Description
Create a calendar for the 9-5 schedule.
Keeping a daily calendar which is accessible via any web browser. This calendar color choices reflect a personal preference. The dark purple color lets you know the hour is in the past. The pink color highlights the current hour and the lavender is for future hours. 
The calendar was built with a basic starter code - mostly HTML and CSS. The addition of JavaScript and jQuery add the option updating and saving appoointments to the calendar as well as the changes in color in connection with time of day. 

I gained a better understanding of local storage and the syntax of jQuery. I used a combination of  JavaScript and jQuery to continue to grow my skillset in both languages.
